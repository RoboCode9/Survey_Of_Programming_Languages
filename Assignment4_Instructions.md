Rectangle Area: The program will ask the user to enter the length and width of a rectangle, and then
display the rectangle’s length, width and area on the computer screen. (See sample output below) The
program’s Main function must call the following four functions:
• getLength – This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s length, validate it, and
then return that value as a double to the main function.
• getWidth - This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s width, validate it, and then
return that value as a double to the main function.
• getArea – This function should accept the rectangle’s length and width as arguments, compute
the rectangle’s area with these arguments and return the rectangle’s area to the main function.
The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width.
• displayData – This function should accept the rectangle’s length, width, and area as arguments,
and display them in an appropriate message on the computer screen (see sample output
below).
Input Validation: Do not accept length and width values lower than 0.
