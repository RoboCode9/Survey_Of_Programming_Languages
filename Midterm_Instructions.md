Write an application that creates different bank accounts. You have to design an object-oriented
solution using two classes.
“BankAccount” class:
Variables (Attributes):
a. first name
b. last name
c. yearly interest rate
d. balance
Functions (Methods):
1. default constructor
2. constructor with one parameter (yearly interest rate)
3. properties
“BankAccountTest” class: instantiate two objects of the “BankAccount” class, checking and saving
accounts and use the constructor to initialize the yearly interest rate for each account (0.5% for checking
account, 2.3% for saving account). Allow the user to input his/her name and the balances for both
accounts. After the user inputs all the data, the program displays user’s name and initial balances for
both accounts. Then, the program calculates the balances with the interest after one year and updates
the balances for both accounts (objects) and displays the new balances for both accounts using Loop.
Repeat the step for two years of balance and display the new balance after two years for both accounts.
Note: use Loop to do the input validation for the Balance (must be a positive amount)
