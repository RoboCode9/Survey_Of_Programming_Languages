Create a class object called “Employee” which included six private variables:
• First Name
• Last Name
• ID number
• Initial Salary
• Start Year
• Current Salary
Also included methods:
• Constructors
• Properties (curSalary is a read-only).
• CalcCurSalary():Calculate the current salary based on a 5% yearly increment from the
startYear.
Create an “EmployeeDemo” class with the main function. In the main function, the program
prompts user to enter the current year. Then, the program reads three company employees’
information from the “EmployeeInfo.txt” file and save the data into three objects. After saving
the data, the program prompts user to enter the range of current salary that you want to see and
display the employee’s information whose current salary is in the range.
